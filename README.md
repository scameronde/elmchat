# Elm-Chat

This is a small example program in Elm and Java.

I have written this code to play with some technologies new to me:

- Java Spark - an embedded REST server with support for web sockets, targeted at micro services
- Elm - a functional language for writing UIs for the browser with client side logic

Especially with Elm I wanted to explore a few aspects:

- modularity
- effects (commands and subscription)
- JSON and REST
- WebSockets

## Detailed information

- [JSON](Json.md)
- [REST](Rest.md)
- [WebSocket](WebSocket.md)
